# MetaHeurstique
Meta-heurstique for the schedule of operations. Transforming .txt into Graph class. Finding minium time by finding the longest path. Finally using .dot to show the result.

# finished
2018.6.3:
  1. visualize the graph with the .dot
  2. get all choix for selected edges
  3. finish the function for changing the color for the not-selected edges
  4. get all-sort order for each machine, and store into the map
  5. finish the function for adding new edges with the selected orders of each machine
# not finished
2018.6.3
 1. blocked in how to get all possibility of all machines orders. too large, impossible to store into vector. But if not stored in vector, can not be generated recursively
 2. find the longest path in the graph
