Thing will be done in the evening
1. Realise the function of finding the longest way in the graph
2. Realise the generator of the choix for the serveral possible paths
3. Realise the generator of the order of every machine
    -> add the arcs in the graph

And add all 3 things in one function, that is the solution
For every possible solution, compare with the solution we have got, so then decide to
change the solution or not

Finally, add the function of drawing the graph in different color by add the paths
